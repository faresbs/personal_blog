##### Hey, Welcome

I am a Computer vision and AI enthusiast. I graduated from University of Quebec at Montreal (UQAM) with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Software Developer at [Hummingbirds AI](http://hummingbirds.ai/) . I'm interested in Artificial intelligence and Machine learning in which I use to Design, build and implement applications to help solve real-world problems. Here's my [Résumé](/downloads/cv.pdf) .

Projects
--------

###### **Sign Language Tutoring System**

*   Automated system that teaches sign language to non-deaf users.
    
*   Evaluate the user's gestures using a recognition system in real time.
*   Learning sign language alphabet (ASL) and some basic signs.
*   Ergonomic Human Machine Interaction Interface (HMI), easy to use and adapted to learning different sign languages (ASL / LSQ).
*   Evaluate the user's gestures using a recognition system in real time.

###### **Using Artificial intelligence for automated hydroponic growing system**

Fares Ben Sliman & Mohamed Chedli Ben Yaghlane

*   Build a prototype of a smart hydroponic growing system.
*   Automatically control the indoor settings using artificial intelligence and rule based system.
*   Detect plant anomalies and diseases through the leaf plant appearance using CNN.

###### **Tracking and predicting student performance in university**

Fares Ben Sliman & Khalid MOUSTAPHA ASKIA

*   Tracking students’ academic performance and accurately predicting their future performance. We used the massive dataset collected by the ['Service de Planification Académique et de Recherche Institutionnelle' (SPARI)](https://spari.uqam.ca/) of the Univeristy of Quebec at Montreal (UQAM).
